# ActiveRagdoll2D-Game

A Unity game demo where you play as a stick figure, you can grab the environment, use a gun and the character uses procedural animations that interacts with the physics environment. The bullets from the gun will destroy specific sprites on impact. If the sprite is separated into multiple parts, each part will become its own object with corresponding pixels. The ventilation tunnel slowly illuminates as the player enters.
